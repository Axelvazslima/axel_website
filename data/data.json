        "content": "<p>Python is a powerful and beginner-friendly programming language that‚Äôs taken the tech world by storm. With its simple, readable syntax, writing Python feels almost like plain English‚Äîmaking it a great first language for anyone new to coding. Want to print \"Hello, World!\"? Just type print(\"Hello, World!\"), and you're good to go‚Äîno complicated setup needed.\nBut don‚Äôt let its simplicity fool you! Python is a powerhouse behind web development, data science, artificial intelligence, automation, and more. Its massive library ecosystem‚Äîlike Django for web apps or Pandas for data analysis‚Äîlets you build almost anything with minimal effort. Plus, with a welcoming community and endless tutorials, you‚Äôll never feel stuck. Whether you‚Äôre looking to create websites, analyze data, or dive into machine learning, Python‚Äôs flexibility and ease of use make it the perfect place to start.</p><br><p>Python is a beginner-friendly language, and learning its basics can get you started quickly. In this tutorial, we'll cover <strong>variables</strong>, <strong>lists</strong>, and <strong>for loops</strong>.</p><br><h3 class='text-lg font-semibold'>1.
